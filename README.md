Edit/ add text of ReadMe file

### On tracking a file
Major concepts of GitHub until now :
- *add* : add a file for tracking
- *commit* : to add the corresponding commit
- *branch* : Enables multiple coders to work / modify on a common copy

### Branches in Github
1. A copy of the master branch exists in all of the other branches
2. On editing, the multiple branches can be merged into a single copy using "merge" command
3. Checkout - used to switch from one branch to another
